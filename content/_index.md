## What is Open EcoAcoustics?

Australia’s biodiversity crisis necessitates urgent action to deliver continental-scale
monitoring and management of threatened species and ecosystems. Our platform aids
ecoacoustics monitoring of these environments and is open to everyone to aggregate
and share data, analyses and tools.

Our vision is to enable open science and conservation through the development
and promotion of open access ecoacoustics technologies, methodologies and standards.

## Our Work

We provide a dedicated ecoacoustics platform that is open to everyone, so that
it can aggregate and share data, analyses and tools, and interoperate with
downstream services. We support FAIR data by developing standardised metadata
and third party analyses by moving to flexible workflow technologies (PBS, docker).
We accelerate data analysis by publishing a shared repository of annotated
datasets and recognisers. We interface to other systems, including TERN, ALA,
EcoCommons and citizen science sites, through services and shared tools.

### Monitoring

Ecoacoustic monitoring provides a non-invasive, complementary strategy to other forms of ecological surveying, supporting the study of wildlife populations and environments.

### Data

Ecoacoustic data provides a record of soniferous fauna allowing the answering of ecological questions such as species occupancy, abundance, behaviour, species richness, and showing trends over time and space.

### Tools

Ecoacoustic data collection and analysis is supported by a range of hardware and software, enabling data management and sharing, as well as sense-making by analysts in both the present and the future.

## Who we are

We are a collection of ecologists, computer scientists, and environmental
managers. Our community extends to Universities, Museums, Government agencies,
and Non-Government Organisations such as BirdLife, Australian Wildlife Conservancy,
Bush Heritage and the Nature Conservancy.

The Open Ecoacoustics project acknowledges Australia’s First Peoples and
Nations. We recognize their long and continuing connection to country, lands,
winds and waters throughout Australia.  For tens of thousands of years, the
First Nations owners have gathered to share their scientific knowledges that are
integral to Indigenous cultures and the sustainable use of country. We honor
this and recognize these lands have always been places of teaching, researching
and learning.  We pay our respects to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
peoples and we welcome opportunities to learn from them and share our learnings.

_This research/project is supported by the Australian Research Data Commons
(ARDC). The ARDC is funded by NCRIS._
