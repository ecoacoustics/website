Open Ecoacoustics is a set of platforms dedicated to continental-scale monitoring
and management of threatened species and ecosystems in response to Australia's
biodiversity crisis. We are a part of the [ARDC Machine Observation Data Processing Infrastructure](https://ardc.edu.au/program/machine-observation-data-processing-infrastructure/). Our goal is to enable open science and conservation by
promoting open access ecoacoustics technologies, methodologies, and standards.
See our up-to-date project plan on [ARDC Ecoacoustics Project](https://ardc.edu.au/project/open-ecoacoustics/) page.

_Open Ecoacoustics received investment ([https://doi.org/10.3565/ts8c-ee10](https://doi.org/10.3565/ts8c-ee10)) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is enabled by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS)._

Our main two projects are [Ecosounds](https://www.ecosounds.org/)
and the [Australian Acoustic Observatory (A2O)](https://acousticobservatory.org/).
We organise events, talks, and educational resources for the community.

Simply put, our goal is to make sense of environmental sound, through training,
tools and big data, to enable ecologists to make better decisions.

## FAIR

We support making ecoacoustic data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR).

{{< columns >}}

### Findable

- Indexed websites​
- Recogniser registry​
- Machine readable metadata: REST API​
- Persistent IDs in RDA
- We are working on supporting Dataset DOI's

<--->

### Accessible

- Open-source by default for both software and A2O data​
- Downloadable software and data​
- Cloud-based software
- REST API

<--->

### Interoperable

- Proof of concept for interoperability with Ecocommons ​
- New tools, e.g. bulk download/upload features​
- Ecoacoustics Metadata Utility (EMU) for metadata standardization

<--->

### Reusable

- Published workflows - case studies Ecocommons​
- [Open Source on GitHub​](https://github.com/ecoacoustics)
- We encourage users to supply citations in the description of their projects
