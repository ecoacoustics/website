Open Ecoacoustics is a set of platforms dedicated to continental-scale monitoring and management of threatened species and ecosystems in response to Australia's biodiversity crisis.  Our goal is to enable open science and conservation by promoting open access ecoacoustics technologies, methodologies, and standards.  Our main two projects are [Ecosounds](https://www.ecosounds.org/) and [Australian Acoustic Observatory (A2o)](https://acousticobservatory.org/). We organise events, talks and support for the community of practice.

Simply put, our goal is to make sense of sounds, through training, tools and big data, to make better decisions.

## FAIR 
We support making ecoacoustic data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR).

{{< columns >}}
### Findable
- Indexed websites​
- Recogniser registry​
- Machine readable metadata: REST API​
- Persistent IDs in RDA
- We are working on supporting Dataset DOI's

<--->

### Accessible
- Open-source by default for both software and A2O data​
- Downloadable software and data​
- Cloud-based software
- REST API

<--->

### Interoperable
- Proof of concept for interoperability with Ecocommons ​
- New tools, e.g. bulk download/upload features​
- Ecoacoustics Metadata Utility (EMU) for metadata standardization

<--->

### Reusable
-  Published workflows - case studies Ecocommons​
-  [Open Source on GitHub​](https://github.com/ecoacoustics)
-  We encourage users to supply citations in the description of their projects
