# About Us
Open EcoAcoustics is a platform dedicated to continental-scale monitoring and management of threatened species and ecosystems in response to Australia's biodiversity crisis.
Our goal is to enable open science and conservation by promoting open access ecoacoustics technologies, methodologies, and standards. 
We provide an inclusive ecoacoustics platform where users can aggregate, share, and analyze data and tools, collaborating with downstream services. 
We acknowledge and honor Australia's First Peoples and their vital contribution to sustainable land use. This project is supported by the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC), funded by NCRIS.
