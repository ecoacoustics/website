### Are you looking for data?
Our best resource for data is the [Australian Acoustic Observatory (A2O)](https://acousticobservatory.org/data/find-data/). The A2O provides data for hundreds of acoustic sensors across seven Australian ecoregions. 

### Do you have data?

- _Do you need to store your data?_
Go to [Ecosounds](https://www.ecosounds.org/)! It is a repository of environmental audio recordings, and you can use the repository for your own projects.

- _Do you want to find data that is similar to yours?_
Try [A2O Audio Similarity Search](https://search.acousticobservatory.org/)

### Do you want to learn?
Go to our [Resources Page](resources) to find community-led information related to ecoacoustics.

We also organise events, talks and workshops. [Join our mailing list](https://forms.office.com/r/Qt9qcdxUKZ) to get involved!
