## Are you looking for data?

Our best resource for data is the [Australian Acoustic Observatory (A2O)](https://acousticobservatory.org/data/find-data/).
The A2O provides data for hundreds of acoustic sensors across seven Australian ecoregions.

You can also search for data using [A2O Search](https://search.acousticobservatory.org/).
Submit any example to find things that sound similar.

### Do you have data?

You can store and share you data at with [Ecosounds](https://www.ecosounds.org/).

It is a repository of environmental audio recordings, and you can use the repository for your own projects.

It's free for the first 50 TB of your data and you control access to your data.
Private, shared with your collaborators, or public, it's your choice.
