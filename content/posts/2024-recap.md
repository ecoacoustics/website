Our team continued to enhance platform operations, refine the Open Ecoacoustics data pipeline, and incorporate more analyses into analysis containers.  

### In 2024, we achieved significant milestones: 

-  1.8 million recordings uploaded 
- 132 years of data duration 
- 186 TB of data uploaded
-  6.7 million recordings downloaded 
- 196 users 

**This means that 24% of all data uploaded to A2O and Ecosounds was ingested last year!**

Thank you for all our partners, users and contributers being part of this journey so far.
