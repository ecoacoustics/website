Our team continued to enhance platform operations, refine the Open Ecoacoustics data pipeline, and incorporate more analyses into analysis containers.  

## In 2024, we achieved significant milestones: 

- 1.8 million recordings uploaded 
- 132 years of data added
- 186 TB of data uploaded
- 6.7 million recordings downloaded 
- 196 new users 

## This means that 24% of all of our data was uploaded to the A2O and Ecosounds just last year!

Thank you to all our partners, users, and contributors being part of this journey so far. We are excited for 2025!
