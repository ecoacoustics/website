We recently kicked off the 2025 **Open Ecoacoustics Webinar Series** with a vibrant
and inspiring session showcasing how ecoacoustics is being used to tackle real-world
conservation challenges across Australia. <!--more--> From endangered cockatoos to fire-affected
forests, our speakers shared powerful examples of how sound-based monitoring is
transforming ecological research and biodiversity management.

## Speakers

We’re thrilled to have 3 speakers sharing their experiences with Open Ecoacoustics at this webinar:

## Lola Lange (QUT): *Ecoacoustic insights into the habitat use and distribution of the endangered Pink Cockatoo*

Lola Lange, a PhD student at QUT, shared her research on the endangered eastern subspecies of the Pink Cockatoo. Using a network of acoustic sensors in the remote Bowra Wildlife Sanctuary, Lola and her team recorded over 19,000 hours of audio to track seasonal habitat use.

**Key findings:**

- Pink Cockatoos shift habitats throughout the year, relying on a mosaic of vegetation types.
- Proximity to permanent water sources was the strongest predictor of activity.
- Acoustic monitoring led to the discovery of previously unknown nesting hollows—critical for conservation planning.

Her work highlights how ecoacoustics can uncover fine-scale ecological patterns in hard-to-reach landscapes.

## Slade Allen-Ankins (JCU): *Detecting threatened and introduced species in ecoacoustic recordings*

Dr. Slade Allen-Ankins from James Cook University demonstrated how AI-powered tools like BirdNET and embedding search are being used to scan millions of hours of audio from the Australian Acoustic Observatory (A2O).

**Highlights:**

- Detected 43 out of 76 targeted threatened species across 63 sites.
- Developed new recognisers and collected over 14,000 validated vocalisations.
- Successfully applied the same methods to detect invasive species like the Asian House Gecko on Christmas Island.

Slade’s work shows how scalable acoustic monitoring can support both conservation and biosecurity efforts.

## Karen Rowe (Museums Victoria): *Leveraging ecoacoustic data to better understand how birds respond to fire*

Karen Rowe, Senior Curator of Birds at Museums Victoria, presented a large-scale project using ecoacoustics to study how birds respond to fire across Victoria.

**Key insights:**

- Acoustic surveys detected more species than traditional point counts, especially when combined with BirdNET.
- The team is now able to model 47% more species responses to fire, improving ecological fire management.
- Ecoacoustic data provides permanent, verifiable records that can be re-analysed as new tools emerge.

Karen’s team is now exploring how regional context and habitat structure shape species’ fire responses.
