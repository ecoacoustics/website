## New Feature: Audio Verification Interface
Last year we finished the first version of an audio verification component. This is an open-source component that can be embedded on any website. We are currently working on adding it to [Ecosounds](https://www.ecosounds.org/). Here is a quick gif to show you how it works:

## Looking Ahead to 2025  
In addition to launching the Verification Interface tool, some of our other plans for 2025 include: 

- Improving mapping visualisations for clearer data coverage views  
- Continuing development of the Acoustic Workbench (The software that runs [A2O](https://acousticobservatory.org/) & [Ecosounds](https://www.ecosounds.org/)). Did you knpow Acoustic Workhbench is open source? See the source code in [GitHub](https://github.com/QutEcoacoustics/workbench)
- Using our new verification interface for citizen science projects  
- Improving the [Make Your Own Recogniser](https://openecoacoustics.org/resources/lessons/make-your-own-recognizer/) workshop and training materials
- Engaging the community through user testing and additional training workshops. Expect us to post an update in the coming months!
