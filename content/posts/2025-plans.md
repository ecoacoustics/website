I hope your 2025 is off to a great start. We at Open Ecoacoustics are excited to keep the community more updated on our
activities and progress. This year, we're committed to providing more regular updates and sharing our work through these
posts and on social media.

## New Feature: Verification Interface

Last year we finished the first version of an annotation verification interface. This tool allows you to efficiently
verify that _tags_ are correctly applied to _annotations_. The interface displays a grid of annotations and their tags
and enables you to quickly determine if these tags accurately match the audio content. For instance, a Koala recognizer
might generate 40 results labeled as *Koala*s. Some of the tags may be be incorrectly applied to traffic sounds. This
tool helps you verify both correct and incorrect tags with quickly ease. You could can then feed the updated results
back into the recognizer to improve its performance.

You can see the interface in action below:

We are currently integrating this feature into Ecosounds. You can find it by:

1. Logging into Ecosounds
2. Selecting a project
3. Choosing _Search Annotations_ so you can filter the annotations you want to verify
4. Clicking on the _Verify This List_ button

In 2025, we plan to add more features, such as saving verifications to our database (currently verifications can only be
downloaded as CSV for your current session), offering more customization options, and enabling other features.

## Looking Ahead to 2025

In addition to launching the Verification Interface tool, some of our other plans for 2025 include:

- Continuing development of the Acoustic Workbench (The software that runs [A2O](https://acousticobservatory.org/) &
  [Ecosounds](https://www.ecosounds.org/)). Did you know Acoustic Workbench is open source? See the source code in
  [GitHub](https://github.com/QutEcoacoustics/workbench)
    - Improving mapping visualisations for clearer data coverage views
    - AAF Integration: Enabling seamless login for Australian universities through the
   [Australian Access Federation](https://aaf.edu.au/).
    - Including an option to include a permanent identifier (PID/DOI) to uploaded data sets.
- Using our new verification interface for citizen science projects
- Improving the [Make Your Own Recogniser](https://openecoacoustics.org/resources/lessons/make-your-own-recognizer/)
  workshop and training materials
- Engaging the community through user testing and additional training workshops. Expect us to post an update in the
    coming months!

Let us know which of these you're most keen for! Do you want something else? Let us know that too! You can send us a
