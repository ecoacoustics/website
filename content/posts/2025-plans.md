## New Feature: Audio Verification Interface
Last year we finished the first version of an audio verification interface. This tool allows you to verify audio tags efficiently. The interface displays tags added to specific audio files, enabling you to quickly determine if these tags accurately match the audio content. For instance, you might have a list of 40 audio snippets labeled as Koalas, but some of the tags are be incorrectly applied to traffic sounds. This tool helps you verify both correct and incorrect tags with ease.

Check out this quick gif to see how it works: {{% figure src="images/verification-interface.gif" caption="Verification Interface." width="50%"%}}

We are currently integrating this feature into Ecosounds. [Try the Beta version of the verification interface](https://www.ecosounds.org/projects/1151/annotations/verify)! In 2025, we plan to add more features, such as saving verifications to our database (currently CSV download only), offering more customization options, and enabling tag addition or editing.

## Looking Ahead to 2025  
In addition to launching the Verification Interface tool, some of our other plans for 2025 include: 

- Improving mapping visualisations for clearer data coverage views
- AAF Integration: Enabling seamless login for Australian universities through the [Australian Access Federation](https://aaf.edu.au/).
- Include option to include a permanent identifier (PID/DOI) to uploaded data sets.
- Continuing development of the Acoustic Workbench (The software that runs [A2O](https://acousticobservatory.org/) & [Ecosounds](https://www.ecosounds.org/)). Did you know Acoustic Workhbench is open source? See the source code in [GitHub](https://github.com/QutEcoacoustics/workbench)
- Using our new verification interface for citizen science projects  
- Improving the [Make Your Own Recogniser](https://openecoacoustics.org/resources/lessons/make-your-own-recognizer/) workshop and training materials
- Engaging the community through user testing and additional training workshops. Expect us to post an update in the coming months!
