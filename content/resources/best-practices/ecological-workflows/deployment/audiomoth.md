For more in-depth advice see the [Getting Started Guide](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/getting-started) on the Open Acoustic Devices page.

## Set-up and Firmware Update
1. [Download Audiomoth Flash and Configuration apps](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/applications) from the Open Acoustic Devices page.
2. **IMPORTANT:** Check that the SD card is formatted and is completely empty before setup 
3. Load Audiomoth with batteries and SD card and connect to computer
    - A minimum 64GB **Sandisk Extreme** Micro SD card should be used. 32GB is too small for 48kHz recordings which will mean that the card will fill up long before the batteries are full.
    - **Energiser Max Plus** are the recommended disposable batteries, but any reputable brand is fine. Eneloop Pro are also commonly used as a rechargeable option but will not last quite as long. Lithium is great if money is no object, but 128GB card recommended if so, or card will fill up before batteries are empty. 
4. Make sure switch is set to *USB/Off*
5. Update Audiomoth to latest firmware using flash app. They update regularly so typically will update all audiomoths before each deployment

## Configuration App
1. Once Audiomoth is on latest firmware open the configuration app
2. Deployment Settings 
    - For typical fauna monitoring (apart from bats etc.) set sample rate to 48kHz.
    - Gain set to medium high is suitable for most applications.
    - Enable sleep/record cyclic recording should be set to on
    - **IMPORTANT:** Sleep duration 5s Recording Duration 3600s
    - All other settings should typically be left on default
3. Schedule
    - As a ballpark figure Audiomoths will usually last between 150-180 hours depending on batteries and climate conditions
        - Program Audiomoths accordingly depending on how long you want them to stay out in the field. 
        - Add recording periods in the schedule tab, the display at the bottom will confirm the amount of files per day
    - File > Local Time helps to avoid confusion with UTC time 
4. Hit configure when you are done. If your configuration has worked, the Audiomoth app will show the current time

## Deployment
- Make sure switch is set to *USB Off* once the Audiomoth is configured.
- Don’t forget to take GPS co-ordinates, but taking a photograph of the recorder is also recommended. Flagging tape is a good option on private property.
- Deployment just involves switching the device to *custom*.
- **Make sure the small microphone on the audiomoth is lined up with the acoustic membrane on your case.**
- When in the field and flicking to custom, the Audiomoth should flash green if it’s outside of the recording schedule, and red if it’s in the recording schedule. Any other flashes means something is wrong. 
    - [See the LED-guide](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/led-guide) on the Open Acoustic Devices page. The most common flash in the field is due to batteries coming out and having to be put back in. This can be fixed by playing a chime through the Audiomoth Phone App 
- On Public Land make sure to keep the Audiomoth well away from any paths, ideally they should not be visible to avoid tampering
