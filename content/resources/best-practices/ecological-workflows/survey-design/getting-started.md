This section needs to encompass the following at a minimum:

Monitoring objective 
Not necessarily your research objective, but what do you want to measure from your acoustic data? E.g. the presence/absence of a bird species, or the diurnal calling activity of a frog. It is important to know what data you want to extract from your audio recordings because this influences most, if not all, of the subsequent decisions on survey design, data processing and so on. Link to more details in Monitoring Objective/Application section below.

What is known about the species and environment?
Existing information inc. Indigenous knowledge; Vocalisations/calls relevant to objectives/hypothesis; Performance of acoustic indices (have they been validated for your study area?); when to pilot and link to more detail in Pilot Studies

Environmental considerations
Access to sites; flooding/fire; proximity to roads/waterways; when to pack a canoe; etc.
