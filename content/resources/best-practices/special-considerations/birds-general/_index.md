## Occupancy
For mobile birds, it is important to consider how you will define occupancy, or use, of a site (see Wood and Peery 2022). This can be important to avoid counting flyovers and brief stopovers.  

Glossy black-cockatoos: Targeting feeding and contact calls, one BAR-LT per site, 7 days sunrise-sunset recording, high recall recogniser, rules for defining occupancy (as minimum, occupancy requires >1 calling bout on a single day)
