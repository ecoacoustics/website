## Description
FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec, and it is one type of compressed
audio files that does not loose information. Being able to store audio files in
a lossless format is really important when ecoacoustics starts to be scale up.
This means storing those files cheaper but also, transferring them gets easier.
You can open and listen `.flac` files in most softwares, but to analyse them,
some tools require for it to be transformed to `.wav` to be able to process it.

Most softwares, like [Raven](https://ravensoundsoftware.com/) and
[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) can open `.flac` files, however, they
do not allow you to export them as `.flac`.
[AnalysisPrograms.exe](https://ap.qut.ecoacoustics.info/basics/introduction.html)
(AP.exe) can run analysis (i.e.: calculate indices and segment) on `.flac`
files.
