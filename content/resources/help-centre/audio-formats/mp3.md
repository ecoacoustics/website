## Description

The MP3 (`.mp3`) audio format is one you are most likely familiar with. This
format uses a type of lossy compression. This means that file sizes can be
reduced significantly, compared to uncompressed audio, which led to the
popularity of this format for digital music. However, lossy compression results
in some information loss, and is therefore not the preferred format for working
with ecoacoustic data. Nevertheless, if you have access to files which were
recorded using the `.mp3` format, it will be possible to open them in most
software and run typical analysis procedures. Otherwise, it is also possible to
convert these files to `.wav` See [Converting]({{< ref "converting" >}}).
