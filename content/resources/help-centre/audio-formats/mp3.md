## Description

The `MP3` (file extension: `.mp3`) audio format is one you are most likely
familiar with. This format uses a type of lossy compression. This means that
file sizes can be reduced significantly, compared to uncompressed audio, which
led to the popularity of this format for digital music. However, lossy
compression results in some information loss, and is therefore not the preferred
format for working with ecoacoustic data. Nevertheless, if you have access to
files which were recorded using the `MP3` format, it will be possible to open
them in most software and run typical analysis procedures. Otherwise, it is also
possible to convert these files to the `WAVE` format. See the [Converting audio
files]({{% relref "converting" %}}) section for more information.
