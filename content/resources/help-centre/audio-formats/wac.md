## Description
WAC (`.wac`) stands for Wildlife Acoustics Compressed Format. This is a legacy
proprietary audio file format used by Wildlife Acoustics. Besides acoustic data,
`.wac` files may also contain GPS information, if the recorder was GPS-enabled.
`.wac` files are supported by the Kaleidoscope Pro Analysis Software. Otherwise,
the bioacoustics package in R is able to read and convert `.wac` files to
`.wav`.
