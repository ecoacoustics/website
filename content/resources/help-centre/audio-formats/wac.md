## Description

`WAC` (file extension: `.wac`) stands for Wildlife Acoustics Compressed Format.
This is a legacy proprietary audio file format used by Wildlife Acoustics.
Besides acoustic data, `WAC` files may also contain GPS information, if the
recorder was GPS-enabled. `WAC` files are supported by the Kaleidoscope Pro
Analysis Software. Otherwise, the bioacoustics package in R is able to read and
convert `WAC` files to the `WAVE` format. See the [Converting audio files with
R]({{% relref "convert-r" %}}) section for more information.
