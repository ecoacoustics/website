"The .wac or Wildlife Acoustics Audio Compression format is a legacy proprietary
audio format produced by Song Meter and Echo Meter recorders. A .wac file may
contain one or more channels (mono or stereo recordings), and these recordings
may be either continuous or triggered. Triggered recordings are used for
ultrasonic work (e.g. recording bats) where only periods of detected activity (a
triggered event or bat pass) are recorded. A triggered .wac file may contain
several triggered events as they are detected independently on each channel. In
addition to acoustic data, .wac files may contain GPS track information when
created by GPS-enabled recorders. "
