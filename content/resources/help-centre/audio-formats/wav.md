## Description

`.wav` or `.wave` is the most common audio format passive acoustic sensors
collect. It is a Waveform Audio file, and that is why it is called `WAVE`. All
commonly used software and analysis packages work well for importing and
exporting `.wav` files since it is the most common audio format used for
acoustic ecology. An advantage of `.wav` is that there is no compression to the
file, so we can analyse these files using different types of software without
any problems. However, the disadvantage of uncompressed files is that they are
usually very large in size, making it more difficult to store and share them. 

`.wav` files may be compressed to a different audio format to reduce their file
size. Before compressing your files or working with compressed audio formats, it
is important to know that some compression formats, such as [`MP3`]({{< ref
"mp3.md" >}}), use a method of compression that can result in a loss of quality
(lossy compression). You can avoid this shortcoming by using lossless
compression formats such as [`FLAC`]({{< ref "flac.md" >}}), where there is no
reduction in quality.
