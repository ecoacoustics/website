## Description

`.wav` or `.wave` is the most common audio format passive acoustic sensors
collect. It is a Waveform Audio file, and that is why it is called `WAVE`. All
audio softwares and packages work fine for importing and exporting `.wav` files
since it is the most common data format used for acoustic ecology. `.wav` is
great because it does not apply any type of compression to the file, so we can
use it in analysis in different types of software without any problems. However,
because these files are not compressed they are usually very large in size,
making it difficult to store and share them. 

`.wav` files may be compressed to reduce their file size. Before compressing
your files or working with compressed audio formats, it is important to know
that some compression formats, such as [`MP3`]({{< ref "mp3.md" >}}), use a
method of compression that can result in a loss of quality (lossy compression).
You can avoid this shortcoming by using lossless compression formats such as
[`FLAC`]({{< ref "flac.md" >}}), where there is no reduction in quality.
