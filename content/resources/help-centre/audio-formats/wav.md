## Description

`.wav` or `.wave` is the most common audio format passive acoustic sensors
collect. It is a Waveform Audio file, and that is why it is called `WAVE`. `.wav`
is great because it does not apply any type of compression to the file, so we
can use it in analysis in different types of software without any problems.
However, not compressing the file comes with a trade-off: these files are
usually very large in size, making it difficult to store and share. Compressing
a file means to removing information from the file to make it smaller. MP3, for
example, is one type of compression of audio files, and that is how you could
store hundreds of songs in an MP3 device or in a CD (if you lived that age). MP3
works well for songs and there is no loss in quality for listening, but when it
comes to analysing the data in terms of acoustic indices, running recognisers,
etc, MP3 does not work, because of the compression. All softwares and packages
work fine in importing and exporting `.wav` files since it is the most common
data format used for acoustic ecology.
