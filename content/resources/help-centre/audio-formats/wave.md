## Description

Waveform Audio File Format, also known as `WAVE` (file extension: `.wav`), is
the most common audio format passive acoustic sensors collect. All commonly used
software and analysis packages work well for importing and exporting `WAVE`
files since it is the most common audio format used for acoustic ecology. An
advantage of `WAVE` is that there is typically no compression to the file, so we
can analyse these files using different types of software without any problems.
However, the disadvantage of uncompressed files is that they are usually very
large in size, making it more difficult to store and share them. 

`WAVE` files may be compressed to a different audio format to reduce their file
size. Before compressing your files or working with compressed audio formats, it
is important to know that some compression formats, such as [`MP3`]({{% ref
"/resources/help-centre/audio-formats/mp3" %}}), use a method of compression
that can result in a loss of quality (lossy compression). You can avoid this
shortcoming by using lossless compression formats such as [`FLAC`]({{% ref
"flac" %}}), where there is no reduction in quality.
