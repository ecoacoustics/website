In this section we will cover the topic of converting audio files. 

## Do I need to convert my audio files? 
Check the file type compatibility of the
software you will be working with. In most cases, the commonly used file types
in ecoacoustics will be supported
and conversions may not be necessary. But if not, you can follow the help
pages below. You may also be interested in learning how to convert between `.wav`
and `.flac` files, to save storage space. 

## How?
The pages listed below will present some solutions for converting between audio
file formats.
