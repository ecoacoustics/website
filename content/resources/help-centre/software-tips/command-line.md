title: The command line
---

## What is it?

The command line, or command-line interface (CLI), is where commands or
instructions can be passed from you, the user, to your computer. Many things
that you do on your computer by clicking on a graphical user interface (GUI),
can also be done in a CLI. For example, creating a new folder, or creating a
text file. 

The CLI is also known as a **CLI shell**. Sometimes simply referred to as a
**shell**. A shell is essentially a program that we open on our computer, in
order to type commands that we want the computer to execute. There are different
'shells' available, depending on your operating system. You have probably seen
or heard about `cmd.exe` or command prompt, which is a type of shell which comes
with Windows by default. But there are other shell programs we can download and
use, which have some added functionalities. For Windows we recommend downloading
and using the following:

- [Windows 
    Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-au&gl=au)
- [Powershell 
  7](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.2)
  - Note: PowerShell 7 is different to PowerShell 5, which is likely already
   installed on your system by default. 

If you are using Linux or macOS, then you can use the Terminal, which is
included by default for those systems. PowerShell 7 is also available for both
[Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-linux?view=powershell-7.2)
and
[macOS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-macos?view=powershell-7.2).
