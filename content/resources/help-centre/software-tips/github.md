## What is it

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a website and service which lets people store
their code in the cloud. In simple terms, you can think of it as being like a
DropBox for developers. But more than being just a place to store code, the
value of GitHub lies in its version control capabilities, and collaborative
community. 

## When to use it

Whether you are writing code by yourself, within a small team, or even as part
of a large collaboration, GitHub can help you to safely and securely manage your
projects.
