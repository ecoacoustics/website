## What is it?

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a website and service which lets people store
their code in the cloud, with a generous free option that has all the features
you will need to get started. In simple terms, you can think of it as being like
a DropBox for developers. But more than being just a place to store code, the
value of GitHub lies in its version control capabilities, and open source
collaborative community. 

## When to use it

Whether you are writing code by yourself, within a small team, or even as part
of a large collaboration, GitHub can help you to safely and securely manage your
projects, and work together with others from all over the world.

## Getting started

If you've never used GitHub or Git version control before, then a great place to
start is the [Hello World](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) quick start
guide provided by GitHub. By following this short tutorial, you will have learnt
a number of skills such as:

- How to make an open source repository (a place where you can store your project)
- How to make a branch (a type of isolated version of your project where you can
  make changes without affecting the main project)
- How to make changes to a file, and "commit" those changes to GitHub
- How to open and merge a pull request - which pulls the content from the branch
  you created, into your main project!
