We'll use the _SRF Data_ and _Annotation Examples_ folders will be used for this practical.

## Software


 - **Raven Lite**: (or Pro if you have a license already)
     - Raven Lite is free, but requires you to sign up for a license
     - Download and sign up [here](https://ravensoundsoftware.com/raven-lite-downloads/)
     - On Windows, you may encounter a _Window Smart Screen_ warning when installing Raven
       - click _More info_ 
       - and then click _Run anyway_ to indicate you trust this software
 - **R and R Studio**:
   - This part is optional, but we will explore a few packages that integrate well with Raven so pre-installation is reccomended
   - Download R Studio [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
   - Download R [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
