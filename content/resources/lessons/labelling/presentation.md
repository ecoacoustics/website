## Recorder settings

-   Sample Rates and Deployment Schedules
-   If in doubt, use a high sample rate.
-   You can always downsample. Higher sample rate = greater compatibility
-   44/48kHz preferable and is becoming industry standard for everything except bats.
-   Only go lower if you have very specific requirements, e.g. Acoustic Observatory
-   Batteries/SD cards/
-   File lengths/Triggers

> Notes:
> only covering this very briefly if no-one else is
