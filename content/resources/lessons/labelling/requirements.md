**Download + Install prior to session:**

-   **Raven Lite** (or Pro if you have a license already)
    -   Raven Lite is free, but requires you to sign up for a license
    -   Download and sign up [here](https://ravensoundsoftware.com/raven-lite-downloads/)
-   **R and R Studio**
    -   Optional to install, but we will explore a few packages that integrate with Raven so pre-installation is recommended
