As part of the 2024 Conference of the Ecological Society of Austalia we are running a workshop for building automated call recognisers. The goal of this workshop was for each participant to leave with a working call recogniser for a single species-call of their choice. It covered some basic theory and practice of building a call recogniser based on embeddings produced by a convolutional neural network. 

This is a collaboration between the QUT ecoacoustics group and The developers of the Perch embedding model and Agile Modelling workflow from Google Research 

This page will be updated closer to the Workshop date, but for now please read over the requirements.
