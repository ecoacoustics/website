# Dataset

You will need a "search" dataset of unlabelled longer recordings totalling between 100 and 1000 hours. Must be uploaded to [Ecosounds](https://www.ecosounds.org) ahead of the workshop. Instructions for this can be found here [Uploading Audio to Ecosounds]({{< ref "#" >}})


# Open-sourcing your recognizer

We hope that if you are successful in creating a working recognizer you will make your recognizer available under an open-source licence (Apache 2.0 https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) so that others may use it, and for the recognizer to be published in our registry: https://openecoacoustics.org/resources/registry/
