Requirements for the Make Your Own Call Recogniser 2024 Workshop

# Dataset

You will need a "search" dataset of unlabelled longer recordings totalling between 100 
and 1000 hours. Must be uploaded to [Ecosounds](https://www.ecosounds.org) ahead of 
the workshop. Instructions for this can be found here 
[Uploading Audio to Ecosounds]({{< ref "../../ecosounds/uploading" >}})

We will pre-process this audio for use in the workshop, so please ensure it's uploaded 
before November 25 2024. 

# Labelled examples

In the workshop you will build a call recogniser using just a few short labelled 
examples. If your search dataset is likely to have plenty of examples of your target 
species, then just having one or two labelled examples is enough. If your search 
dataset is likely to have very few or maybe no occurrences of the target species, 
then you should ideally bring a few more, say 10-20 labelled examples. 
 

# Open-sourcing your recogniser

We hope that if you are successful in creating a working recogniser you will make 
your recogniser available under an open-source licence (Apache 2.0 
https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) so that others may use it, and for the 
recogniser to be published in our registry: https://openecoacoustics.org/resources/registry/
