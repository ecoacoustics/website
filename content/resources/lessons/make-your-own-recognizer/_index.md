title: Make Your Own Recogniser
---
As part of the QUT Ecoacoustics symposium we will be running a one day workshop for building automated call recognisers. This will be a limited place workshop, suited to ecologists and landholders who are already collecting acoustic data and wish to analyse it. The goal of the workshop is for each participant to leave with a working call recogniser for a single species-call of their choice.  The workshop will cover some basic theory and practise of building a call recogniser using a convolutional neural network.

Our facilitators include **Dr Philip Eichinski**, and **Dr Lance De Vine**.

**Dr Eichinski** is a postdoctoral researcher and research software engineer specialising in machine learning for species call recognition. See his most recent publication: “A Convolutional Neural Network Bird Species Recognizer Built From Little Data by Iteratively Training, Detecting, and Labeling”.

**Dr De Vine** is a researcher in data science and machine learning with applications to multi-disciplinary research. Lance has been working on building species recognisers for five threatened species in the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia WHA, as well as the Glossy Black Cockatoo.

**This workshop will cost an additional $75.**

## Expression of interest

Please email ecoacoustics2022@qut.edu.au the following:

- Your name, role and organisation
- A short description of your project including goals of the project, acoustic data you are collecting, species and call of interest. Please include a link to an example of the call you are interested in detecting or a short sound snippet containing the call.
- Confirmation that you will make your recogniser available under an open-source license (Apache 2.0 https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)
- Include ‘Recogniser workshop EOI’ in the subject line.

The deadline for submitting EOIs is **Friday 16th September**. We will notify successful applicants by Wednesday 21st September.
