Welcome to the Make Your Own Recogniser workshop!

This lesson will use a python notebook running on Google colab. The steps to get this running are


## Open the colab notebook

In your browser, navigate to <https://colab.research.google.com/github/QutEcoacoustics/perch/blob/esa-scripts/chirp/projects/agile2/2_agile_modeling_slim.ipynb>

You should see a python notebook consisting of cells of text and python code you can run. 

## Make an editable copy

Although you can run and edit this notebook, and edits you make can not be saved. So that you can save any changes you do, make a copy in your google drive account. 

1. Open the notebook in Colab
2. Click **File** in the top menu
3. Select **Save a copy in Drive**

This should open an new tab named "Copy of ...".  Close the original notebook and rename the new copy to whatever you like. 

## Follow the steps in the notebook

The remaining practical steps are contained in the colab notebook. Have fun!
