title: Practical Steps
---

The materials for this workshop will be delivered in a **Jupyter Notebook**. 

A Jupyter Notebook allows you to run python code embedded in a web page, that you can view in your web browser.

To get started, you will need to 

1) Use Anaconda to create and activate a virtual environment
2) Download the recognizer python scripts
3) Use Anaconda to launch the jupyter notebook

# Create your virtual environment

You should already have anaconda installed on your computer. If you don't, you can find how to install it here: 

- On Windows: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/
- On Mac: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/

Once you have anaconda installed, you can open it like any other program. 

1) On the left, select the `Environments` Tab

2) At the bottom of the screen click `create`

3) Give the environment a name. It doesn't matter what, but something like "recogniser-workshop". 
4) Choose a python version. Version 3.8.x or 3.9.x will work fine. 
5) Click "create"

This creates a "conda environment". This is a folder on your computer that will contain all of the python related dependencies for running the recognizer python scripts. 

For more information see https://docs.anaconda.com/navigator/tutorials/manage-environments/

# Download the recognizer python scripts

1) Navigate to ##### TODO: Insert repo URL ####. 
2) Click on the green "Code" button to open a dropdown 
3) Select "Download Zip" to download a zip file to your machine. 
4) In your computer's file explorer, find the file you downloaded and unzip it

# Use Anaconda to launch the jupyter notebook 

Back in the anaconda desktop app, 

1) Go to the Home tab in the Applications pane on the right

2) Find the Jupyter Lab tile and click the Install button

3) After installation is complete, click "Launch"

This will open a page in a web browser, with the url starting with "localhost". You should see a file browser on the left

4) Use that file browser to navigate to the folder you unzipped in step 2 above. 
5) Click on the file `workshop.ipynb`

This should open up a page in your browser where you can see the materials for the workshop
