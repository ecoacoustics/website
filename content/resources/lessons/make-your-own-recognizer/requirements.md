title: Requirements
---

-   This is a face to face workshop and all attendees will be required to register for the main symposium, as well as attending the workshop on Friday.
-   Participants will need to attend an online pre-workshop session and to bring along example labelled call data for the workshop (20-200 example calls, and 20-100 negative examples from real recordings), plus a few hours of unlabelled audio that is known to contain your call of interest; exact details will be provided to participants.
-   To undertake the workshop participants need to be comfortable with executing simple command line programs; itâ€™s also advantageous to have some programming experience (e.g. R or Python) although programming experience is not required. All the tools used to build the recogniser will be freely available, as will the workshop notes.
-   This is part of an open science initiative. Participants need to be willing to make their recogniser available under an open-source licence (Apache 2.0 https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) so that others may use it, and for the recogniser to be published in a registry.
