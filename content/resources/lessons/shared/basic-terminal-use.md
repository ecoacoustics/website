{{% hint info %}}
Anytime you see command to run, we'll present it in a code
box that will look like this.

```bash
> <command to run>
```

The `>` denotes a prompt, which is your cue to run 
the command after the prompt.

For example:

```bash
> mkdir results
```

You would type (or copy and paste) `mkdir results` into your
terminal. Do not include the prompt (the `>` symbol).

To run a command press <kbd>Enter</kbd> on your keyboard.

We might include a comment (a line starting with a `#`) and 
we might show you the output of your command as well.

```bash
# I am a comment
> echo "I am output"
I am output
```

Often we will omit the output for brevity.

Previous commands can be run again by using the up and down
arrow keys to cycle through those commands.
