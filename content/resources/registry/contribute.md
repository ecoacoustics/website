You can make a contribution directly by adding a data file in the [recognizer_registry](https://github.com/ecoacoustics/website/tree/main/data/recognizer_registry) folder. See the pages [why publish your recognizers](why-publish) and [how to publish a recognizer](/resources/registry/publishing) for more information.

Alternately, fill in the following form to list your recognizer in the registry.

After a short review process it will be added to the registry.
