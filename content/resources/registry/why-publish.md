## Why publish your recognizer?

Publishing your recognizer can be a valuable way to contribute to open science and help the development of ecoacoustics as a tool for conservation.

If you [contribute to the registry](contribute) your work will be submitted to the Open Ecoacoustics team, who after reviewing it will add it to the [registry](/resources/registry) making it publicly available. The Open Ecoacoustics team may email you to gather more information but your email won't be published in the registry for privacy reasons. If you need help publishing, see the [how to publish a recognizer](/resources/registry/publishing) page.
