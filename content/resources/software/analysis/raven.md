## Data Upload

WAV, AIF, MP3, FLAC

## Output Files

Selection tables output .txt format files (including annotation /
detection measurements).

## Data

Can open and save sound files, selection files or workspace files from
directories.

## Inspection

Waveform and spectrogram viewer.

## Analysis

1. Spectrogram analysis (square correlation matrix containing similarity
measures for all possible pairs of input sounds).
2. Band-Limited Energy Detector (BLED) (to detect events of specified duration.)

## Annotation

1. Manually draw boxes on spectrograms or other views.
2. 70+ measurements available for rectangular time-frequency selections around
signals of interest

## Species ID

Assign label

## Batch Analysis

Band-Limited Energy Detector (BLED)

## Recogniser Building

To build Band-Limited Energy Detector (BLED): specify duration of detected
event in user-defined frequency band that exceeds background noise by
adjustable threshold.

## Recogniser Tuning

Band-Limited Energy Detector (BLED) can be run in interactive mode for
tine-tuning detection parameters

## Performance

Quantitative assessment of detector performance.

## Review Detection

Selection review interface for automatic detections, matrix of thumbnail
images of selections

## Computing
