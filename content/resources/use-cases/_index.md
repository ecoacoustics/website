title: Use Cases for Ecoacoustics
---

Open Ecoacoustics has a vision to "enable open science and conservation through
the development and promotion of open access ecoacoustics technologies,
methodologies and standards". Biodiversity inventories and monitoring in
Australia are difficult due to the vast and remote areas that few people visit,
and is further confounded by some species which are exceedingly difficult to
detect. Now image a 10 to 20 fold decrease in the time required in the field to
generate verifiable occurrence data for species which vocalise, perhaps only
occasionally, across vast temporal and spatial scales. The potential value that
this kind of data holds is clear. So, this section of the website is where we
aim to showcase how ecoacoustic data can be a game changer for our understanding
of species distributions, by harnessing analysis methods that have typically
been used with data collected by traditional survey techniques.
