title: Use Cases for Ecoacoustics
---

Open Ecoacoustics has a vision to "enable open science and conservation through
the development and promotion of open access ecoacoustics technologies,
methodologies and standards".  Biodiversity inventories and monitoring in
Australia are difficult due to the vast areas of remote areas few people visit
which are confounded by some species which are exceedingly difficult to detect.
Imagine a 10 to 20 fold decrease in the time required in the field to generate
verifiable occurrence data for species which vocalise, perhaps only
occasionally. While this is clearly a huge challenge, the tools and workflows
being developed, and showcased by Open Ecoacoustics, are demonstrating how this
can be achieved. In this section of the website, we aim to showcase how
ecoacoustic data can be a game changer for our understanding of species
distributions.
