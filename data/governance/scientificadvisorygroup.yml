- name: Prof. Lin Schwarzkopf
  affiliation: James Cook University
  description: Prof. Schwarzkopf is based at James Cook University. Her research examines broad ecological and evolutionary questions. She takes an integrative approach, using a combination of controlled experiments and observational studies to test hypotheses in both theoretical and applied contexts.  Much of her research has used reptiles and amphibians as model systems, but she is interested in a variety of vertebrate groups as subjects of study. A developing area of interest is refining the use of long-term sound recordings to understand the breeding patterns of frogs very broadly, across Australia.

- name: Prof. Dave Watson
  affiliation: Charles Sturt University
  description: Dave’s research strives to answer the overarching question—why are some places more diverse than others?  In addition to historical biogeography and distributional ecology, he uses plant-animal interactions to explore the mechanistic basis of observed patterns, with an emphasis on mistletoe and other parasitic plants.  He has developed and refined methods to estimate biodiversity, with particular interest in acoustic monitoring to derive robust indices of diversity to inform conservation policy and planning.  In addition to deserts and temperate woodlands, he has conducted extensive fieldwork in tropical rainforests, collaborating with Traditional Owners, farmers, non-governmental organizations and industry partners.

- name: Dr Paul McDonald
  affiliation: University of New England
  description: Paul established the Animal Behaviour and Ecology Lab (ABEL) upon moving to the University of New England in 2010. He has worked on a range of projects over his career, but has long-standing interests in acoustic communication, sociality and adapting existing technology to ask new and exciting questions. He teaches first year biology, zoology and a third year animal behaviour at UNE, as well as leading the Overseas Study Tour focusing on Botswanan Zoology. He was a past President of the Australasian Society for the Study of Animal Behaviour and a past member and Chair of the Research and Conservation Committee of Birdlife Australia. In addition, he is a Subject Editor of the Journal of Avian Biology and an Associate Editor of Emu Austral Ornithology.  At present he is the Acting Convenor of Teaching and Learning and Deputy Head of School for the School of Environmental and Rural Science at UNE.

- name: Dr Elisabeth Znidersic
  jobTitle: Research Fellow
  affiliation: Charles Sturt University
  description: Dr Elizabeth (Liz) Znidersic is an ecologist and Post-doctoral Research Fellow in the Institute for Land, Water and Society, Charles Sturt University. Her current research interests fall into two principal areas. Firstly, survey methodologies using advanced technology to monitor individual species and ecosystems. And secondly, species eradications (invasive and feral species), translocations and reintroductions, particularly on islands. Most of her research is applied ecology, improving our understanding of endangered species and the management of natural systems. Liz has worked as a researcher in both the USA and Australia. During the last 10 years she has pioneered methods (including acoustics and cameras trapping) now widely used to investigate and detect secretive wetland birds. One of her current projects is “Eavesdropping on wetland birds – Optimizing technology for monitoring wetland bird populations across south-eastern Australia”. This interdisciplinary project with computer scientists is monitoring wetland species over a large scale.

- name: Dr Matt West
  jobTitle: Research Fellow
  affiliation: University Of Melbourne
  description: Dr Matt West is an applied ecologist and Research Fellow at the University of Melbourne. His research focuses on evaluating wildlife population trajectories, identifying processes and threats that influence population dynamics, and developing practical solutions to protect threatened species.  To achieve this, Matt utilizes traditional and innovative wildlife monitoring and statistical methods and works collaboratively with others, including wildlife and conservation management agencies, community groups, and traditional owners. Recognizing the emerging benefits of acoustics monitoring approaches for assessing wildlife populations, Matt helped to lead and prepare the successful Australian Research Data Commons Open EcoAcoustics grant application.

- name: Prof. Rich Fuller
  affiliation: University of Queensland
  description: Richard Fuller is a Professor at the University of Queensland. He studies how people have affected the natural world around them, and how some of their destructive effects can best be reversed. To answer these questions, the lab group works on pure and applied topics in biodiversity and conservation, spanning the fields of migration ecology, conservation planning and urban ecology. Much of the work is interdisciplinary, focusing on the interactions between people and nature, how these can be enhanced, and how these relationships can be shaped to converge on coherent solutions to the biodiversity crisis.
