  targets:
    - name: Koala
      taxonomic: Phascolarctos cinereus
      calls: [ 'grunt', 'inhale']
    - name: Kangaroo
      taxonomic: Macropus giganteus
      context: this recogniser was done to find koalas all over their distribution and develop species distribution models for 
      past, current and future climate and deforestation for this species. Therefore we wanted to maximise the true positive rates, to find as many koala's calls as possible.

  targets:
    - name: Grey shrikethrush
      taxonomic: Colluricincla harmonica
      calls: [ 'grunt', 'inhale']
      context: this recogniser was developed aiming to find a rare endangered species, so false positive rates were minimised. We needed as much false positives as possible.
