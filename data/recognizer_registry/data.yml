- title: Koala recognizer
  description: |
    this recogniser was done to find koalas all over their distribution and develop species distribution
    models for past, current and future climate and deforestation for this species.
    Therefore we wanted to maximise the true positive rates, to find as many koala's calls as possible.
  targets:
    - name: Koala
      taxonomic: Phascolarctos cinereus
      variants: ["grunt", "inhale"]
    - name: Kangaroo
      taxonomic: Macropus giganteus
  datasets:
    training:
      summary: 30-second segments, manually annotated
      location: Samford Ecological Research Facility, Brisbane, Australia
      url: https://www.ecosounds.org/projects/397
      performance:
        # or event
