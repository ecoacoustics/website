- title: Koala recognizer
  description: |
    this recogniser was done to find koalas all over their distribution and develop species distribution
    models for past, current and future climate and deforestation for this species.
    Therefore we wanted to maximise the true positive rates, to find as many koala's calls as possible.
  targets:
    - name: Koala
      binomial: Phascolarctos cinereus
      variants: ["grunt", "inhale"]
    - name: Kangaroo
      binomial: Macropus giganteus
