# - title: Koala recognize(demo data)
#   description: |
#     this recognizer was done to find koalas all over their distribution and develop species distribution
#     models for past, current and future climate and deforestation for this species.
#     Therefore we wanted to maximize the true positive rates, to find as many koala's calls as possible.
#   targets:
#     - name: Koala
#       binomial: Phascolarctos cinereus
#       variants: ["grunt", "inhale"]
#     - name: Kangaroo
#       binomial: Macropus giganteus
#   datasets:
#     training:
#       summary: 30-second segments, manually annotated
#       location: Samford Ecological Research Facility, Brisbane, Australia
#       url: https://www.ecosounds.org/projects/397
#       performance:
#         # segment or event
#         criteria: segment
#         tp: 100
#         fp: 12
#         tn: 10
#         fn: 10
#     test:
#       summary: 30-second segments, manually annotated

#       performance:
